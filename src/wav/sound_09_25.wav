<p>Some people appear to have a mental illness because they have a <a class="offsite" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22vitamin+B%22+mental+health">vitamin B deficiency</a>. For example, the wife of a guy I used to chat with online had severe mood swings which seemed to be caused by food allergies or intolerances. She would became irrational, obnoxious, throw tantrums, and generally act like she had a mental illness. The horrid behavior stopped after she started taking a vitamin B complex. I&rsquo;ve been taking <a class="offsite" href="https://amzn.to/2QLBO6z">#ad Jarrow B-Right</a> for many years. It makes me much easier to live with.</p>

The sinister encroachment of soy has made the careful reading of ingredients a necessity.</p>

<div class="jumpid" id="icydnk_hydroxychloroquine">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="bigtext"><a href="#icydnk_hydroxychloroquine">Hydroxychloroquine = Good</a></p>
<p>Although some people with certain conditions may not be able to take it, <a class="offsite" href="https://www.randomterrain.com/rt-covid-19-videos.html#hydroxychloroquine">hydroxychloroquine</a> is a cheap drug that has been prescribed by doctors since the 1950s and it seems to be helping many people who have COVID-19 when administered early enough. (Hydroxychloroquine is also supposedly <a class="offsite" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320166">safe and tolerable as an anti-cancer therapy</a>.) Seems like most news sources are going out of their way to make it sound like hydroxychloroquine is the most dangerous drug in the world, but they also make it sound like it&rsquo;s the greatest drug in the world for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis patients. They basically say that using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients would be taking that great and wonderful drug away from the other patients who need it. So which is it? Is hydroxychloroquine deadly or divine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe that a couple of Trump supporters took the medicine hydroxychloroquine and it&rsquo;s President Trumps fault that the husband died, you&rsquo;ve been <a class="offsite" href="https://www.randomterrain.com/rt-covid-19-videos.html#duping_delight">duped</a>. <a class="offsite" href="https://youtu.be/9ptTFmzJWfg">Watch this video</a>. The wife was a prolific Democratic donor, it seems she hated her husband, she used fish tank cleaner (not the medicine hydroxychloroquine), and now she is the subject of a homicide investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people claim that the reason so many news sources want to keep doctors from using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 is that they are desperate to keep everyone afraid to leave their homes since mail-in voting will make voter fraud much easier (the only way they could beat Trump). Others claim that the rabid anti-hydroxychloroquine campaign was to make way for the expensive new drug called remdesivir. Drug companies can&rsquo;t make much money with old generic drugs, so new drugs must be pushed. Both claims could be true since remdesivir supposedly isn&rsquo;t as good as hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a class="offsite" href="https://youtu.be/AjZengaT6wI?t=3556">Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai</a>, hydroxychloroquine does four things: (1) stops viral entry, (2) stops viral RNA replication, (3) stops viral particle assembly, and (4) stops cytokine storm. Remdesivir only stops viral RNA replication. Did you get that? Hydroxychloroquine does four things and remdesivir only does one. The doctor also said that nearly 70 percent of the people who took remdesivir had some type of adverse effect. If all of that is true and the more anemic medicine ends up being used by most doctors thanks to the smear campaign against hydroxychloroquine, the average American will beg to vote from home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know, <a class="offsite" href="https://twitter.com/HowleyReporter/status/1252735675503464453">Patrick Howley</a> reported that one of the authors of the &lsquo;study&rsquo; saying that hydroxychloroquine doesn&rsquo;t work at VA hospitals got a research grant from Gilead (the company that makes remdesivir). Does that seem a little fishy to you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:14px;">Bryan Fischer said in an <a class="offsite" href="https://onenewsnow.com/perspectives/bryan-fischer/2020/04/27/fauci-knew-about-hcq-in-2005-nobody-needed-to-die">article</a> that Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.

One nursing home in NE Ohio had 30 cases - started everyone on HCQ, no deaths. Quick recovery. Why would the MSM hide this?
